/**
 * Releases an answer a paragraph at a time, while it is still being written.
 *
 * A chat is a sequence of messages, not one long block: the agent is told a blank line ends a
 * message, and this is what makes that true. Holding the whole answer until the run finishes
 * and cutting it up afterwards produces the same words in the same order, but they all land at
 * once, minutes after the person asked — which is what reading a burst of notifications feels
 * like instead of a conversation.
 *
 * Only a paragraph with more text behind it is released. The last one is left to be the run's
 * answer, so a run always ends with something to show and nothing is sent twice.
