 * Anthropic reuses a prompt only up to a point the request marks, and re-reading that prefix

 *
 * - on the first message, which puts the tool definitions and the instructions behind it —
 *   the largest stable block of every request, and identical across a whole conversation;
 * - on the last two messages, so the turns and tool results already accumulated are read back
 *   instead of re-sent. A mark at the head alone would cache the head and nothing else, since
 *   what is reused is the prefix that ends at a mark.
 *
 * Marks are stripped before being placed: the loop hands its own messages back on every step,
 * and leaving the old ones would add a breakpoint per step until Anthropic refused them. A
 * prefix below the model's minimum is simply not cached, so marking a short prompt costs
 * nothing.
