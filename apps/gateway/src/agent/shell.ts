/**
 * Running commands on the machine the gateway runs on, with the file tools beside them.
 *
 * There is no sandbox and no allow-list of directories: the owner asked for the whole machine,
 * and these tools run with the privileges of whoever started the gateway. What bounds them is
 * the profile switch that hands them out at all — everything here is off unless `allowShell`
 * is on for that profile.
 *
 * Read this as what it is: anyone who can make this agent act — including an approved contact
 * on a chat channel — can make it run a command. The limits below are about keeping a run
 * alive and its results readable, not about containment. A `guard`, when given, is asked before
 * each action that changes the machine; it is a second opinion, not a boundary.
