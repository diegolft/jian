# Deployment

The gateway runs three ways. The first uses a clone of the repository; the other two use the same published image, `ghcr.io/lucasaarch/jian-gateway`, with the database in your hands. Migrations run by themselves when the process starts: there is no separate migration step, and a new version applies what is missing as it comes up.

The image is a multi-architecture index with `linux/amd64` and `linux/arm64`, built on native runners with a provenance attestation attached. To check it before running:

```bash
gh attestation verify oci://ghcr.io/lucasaarch/jian-gateway:latest --repo lucasaarch/jian
```

## Way 1 — clone and Compose

Brings the gateway and PostgreSQL up together. This is the path for a single machine.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/lucasaarch/jian.git && cd jian
make setup
make up
```

`make setup` writes `.env` with mode `0600`, holding the host token, the database password and the encryption keyring; it never prints a secret. `make up` pulls the image, waits for the database to be healthy, and only then starts the gateway. `make logs` follows the log, `make ps` shows the state, and `make down` stops the stack without deleting the volume.

`compose.yaml` publishes the gateway on `127.0.0.1:4310`. To reach it beyond localhost, put an HTTPS proxy in front and change the address with `JIAN_BIND_ADDRESS` and `JIAN_BIND_PORT`. The PostgreSQL port is not published: only the gateway reaches it, over the Compose network.

`JIAN_VERSION` pins the image version; without it, Compose uses `latest`. To run your own build instead of the published image, uncomment the `build:` block in `compose.yaml` and use `docker compose up -d --build`.

`compose.dev.yaml` is a different thing: it brings up PostgreSQL alone, on `127.0.0.1:5432`, so `pnpm dev` can run on the machine. It has its own project name and volume, so the development database and the production one share nothing, even on the same host.

## Way 2 — the image on its own

With a PostgreSQL you already run:

```bash
docker run -d --name jian --restart unless-stopped \
  -p 127.0.0.1:4310:4310 \
  -e DATABASE_URL='postgres://user:password@db.internal:5432/jian' \
  -e JIAN_API_TOKEN="$JIAN_API_TOKEN" \
  -e JIAN_ACTIVE_KEY_ID=v1 \
  -e JIAN_MASTER_KEYS="$JIAN_MASTER_KEYS" \
  ghcr.io/lucasaarch/jian-gateway:latest
```

The image carries a health check against `/health`; `docker ps` shows its result. The process runs as the unprivileged `node` user and writes nothing outside the database.

## Way 3 — Kubernetes

The same image, with the secrets in a `Secret` and the service internal to the cluster. Keep `replicas: 1` while a migration is pending: it runs at startup, and simultaneous replicas race for it. Once applied, more replicas are safe.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: jian
type: Opaque
stringData:
  DATABASE_URL: postgres://jian:senha@postgres:5432/jian
  JIAN_API_TOKEN: troque-por-um-token-aleatorio-de-32-caracteres
  JIAN_ACTIVE_KEY_ID: v1
  JIAN_MASTER_KEYS: '{"v1":"troque-por-32-bytes-aleatorios-em-base64"}'
---
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: jian
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels: { app: jian }
  template:
    metadata:
      labels: { app: jian }
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: gateway
          image: ghcr.io/lucasaarch/jian-gateway:0.1.0
          envFrom:
            - secretRef: { name: jian }
          env:
            - name: HOST
              value: 0.0.0.0
          ports:
            - containerPort: 4310
          readinessProbe:
            httpGet: { path: /health, port: 4310 }
            periodSeconds: 10
          livenessProbe:
            httpGet: { path: /health, port: 4310 }
            initialDelaySeconds: 30
            periodSeconds: 30
          securityContext:
            runAsNonRoot: true
            allowPrivilegeEscalation: false
            capabilities: { drop: [ALL] }
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: jian
spec:
  selector: { app: jian }
  ports:
    - port: 80
      targetPort: 4310
```

Pin an exact version on the image; with `latest`, any restart changes the code without warning. Expose it through an Ingress with TLS, never the `Service` directly.

`JIAN_ROLE=all` runs the API and the worker in one process. To split them, use two Deployments, `api` and `worker`, sharing the same database and the same keyring; only `api` gets the `Service`.

## Environment variables

| Variable | Required | Default | What it does |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `DATABASE_URL` | yes | — | The PostgreSQL connection. The process migrates the schema at startup. |
| `JIAN_API_TOKEN` | yes | — | The host token, at least 32 characters. It also signs the panel cookies. |
| `JIAN_ACTIVE_KEY_ID` | yes | — | The id of the keyring key used for new writes. |
| `JIAN_MASTER_KEYS` | yes | — | JSON mapping an id to a 32-byte key in Base64. Keep it out of the database backup. |
| `HOST` | no | `0.0.0.0` in the image | The listening address inside the container. |
| `PORT` | no | `4310` | The listening port; the health check follows it. |
| `JIAN_ROLE` | no | `all` | `all`, `api` or `worker`. |
| `JIAN_ALLOW_PRIVATE_ORIGINS` | no | empty | Exact private origins allowed for outbound calls, for example `http://127.0.0.1:11434`. |
| `JIAN_PUBLIC_URL` | no | — | Where a browser reaches this gateway. An MCP server that signs in with OAuth redirects the owner back to it; without it, that sign-in is unavailable. |
| `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` | Compose only | — | The PostgreSQL password in `compose.yaml`; it also builds the service's `DATABASE_URL`. |
| `JIAN_VERSION` | Compose only | `latest` | The image tag `compose.yaml` uses. |
| `JIAN_BIND_ADDRESS` | Compose only | `127.0.0.1` | The host address the gateway port is published on. |
| `JIAN_BIND_PORT` | Compose only | `4310` | The host port the gateway is published on. |

Provider, MCP and channel keys do not live in the environment: they are typed in the panel and stored encrypted with the keyring. See [security](security.md).

## Published tags

| Tag | When it is written |
| --- | --- |
| `1.2.3` | The tag `v1.2.3`. The only immutable one. |
| `1.2` | The tag `v1.2.3`; moves to the latest fix in that series. |
| `latest` | The tag `v1.2.3`; moves to the most recent published version. |

## Updating and rolling back

Updating means changing the tag and starting again. The migration runs at startup.

```bash
# Compose: pin the version in .env and recreate the container
echo 'JIAN_VERSION=1.3.0' >> .env && make up

# Standalone container
docker pull ghcr.io/lucasaarch/jian-gateway:1.3.0
docker rm -f jian && docker run -d --name jian ... ghcr.io/lucasaarch/jian-gateway:1.3.0

# Kubernetes
kubectl set image deployment/jian gateway=ghcr.io/lucasaarch/jian-gateway:1.3.0
```

Take a dump before updating: a migration changes the schema and does not undo itself.

```bash
docker compose exec postgres pg_dump -U jian -Fc jian > jian-$(date +%F).dump
```

Rolling back means pointing at the previous version — `make up` with another `JIAN_VERSION`, or `kubectl rollout undo deployment/jian`. That reverts the code, **not** the schema: a migration already applied stays in the database. If the older version refuses the newer schema, restore the dump:

```bash
docker compose exec -T postgres pg_restore -U jian -d jian --clean --if-exists < jian-2026-09-22.dump
```

Published migrations are immutable; a fix arrives as the next version, never as a change to the previous one.

## Where the data lives

Everything persistent is in PostgreSQL: profiles, sessions, history, memories, runs, the pg-boss queue and the credential vault. The gateway container holds no state — destroying and recreating it loses nothing.

Under Compose the database lives in the named volume `jian_postgres_data`; the development one lives in `jian-dev_postgres_data`. `make down` keeps the volume, `docker compose down -v` deletes it. `make db-reset` deletes the development one on purpose.

The `JIAN_MASTER_KEYS` keyring lives outside the database, in `.env` or in a secret manager. Without it a database backup is useless: the vault will not open. Keep it apart, and keep the older entries until every secret has been re-entered under the new key.

## Publishing

The `Image` workflow builds on two native runners, `ubuntu-24.04` and `ubuntu-24.04-arm`, each pushing by digest, and a final job joins them into a multi-architecture index. Nothing is emulated. It runs on a `v*.*.*` tag and nowhere else.

Release Please keeps a release pull request open, gathering the conventional commits since the last publication. Merging it writes the version into `package.json`, the `CHANGELOG.md` and the tag `v1.2.3`; that tag is what publishes the image.

For that to work the owner has to turn on a permission that ships off: under **Settings → Actions → General → Workflow permissions**, tick **Allow GitHub Actions to create and approve pull requests**. Without it the workflow fails when opening the release pull request.
